## ⚠️ Before this goes live

| # | What | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Fill in the Impressum.** Owner name, VAT ID, and the licensing authority are visible `[placeholders]`. An incomplete Impressum is a real legal risk in Germany (§ 5 DDG). | `src/lib/i18n/de.ts`, `en.ts` |
| 2 | **Have the privacy policy reviewed.** Written for this site as built (server logs, taxi.de iframe, WhatsApp) — but it is not legal advice. | `src/lib/i18n/de.ts`, `en.ts` |
| 3 | **Re-check the taxi tariff.** The figures follow the Taxentarifordnung in force since 1 Sept 2022. These are legally binding prices — verify against the current ordinance and update on every amendment. | `src/lib/tariff.ts` |
| 4 | **Confirm 24/7 availability** — assumed, and stated on every page and in the structured data. | `src/lib/business.ts` |
| 5 | **Check the health-insurance details** (Muster 4 prescription, prior approval, 10% / 5–10 € co-payment) against how you actually bill. | `src/lib/i18n/de.ts`, `en.ts` |
| 6 | **Sanity-check distances and journey times** on the airport and Air Base pages. | `src/lib/i18n/de.ts`, `en.ts` |
| 7 | **Confirm base access.** The Air Base page states you send a driver with an access card when told in advance, and only reach the gate otherwise. | `src/lib/i18n/de.ts`, `en.ts` |
| 8 | **Replace the stock photo** with pictures of your own cars. See *Photos* below. | `public/photos/`, `src/lib/photos.ts` |

`pref=24075` now correctly resolves to "City Taxi Kaiserslautern" in the booking
widget — verified, no longer an issue.

## Pages

Fourteen pages per language, all prerendered as static HTML with localised slugs.

| Page | German | English | Where it is linked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | `/de` | `/en` | menu |
| Services | `/de/leistungen` | `/en/services` | menu |
| Fares | `/de/taxipreise-kaiserslautern` | `/en/taxi-fares-kaiserslautern` | menu |
| Booking | `/de/taxi-online-bestellen` | `/en/order-a-taxi-online` | menu |
| Contact | `/de/kontakt` | `/en/contact` | menu |
| City rides | `/de/taxi-kaiserslautern-stadtfahrten` | `/en/city-taxi-rides-kaiserslautern` | footer + service card |
| Medical transport | `/de/krankenfahrten-kaiserslautern` | `/en/medical-transport-kaiserslautern` | footer + service card |
| Large-capacity taxi | `/de/grossraumtaxi-kaiserslautern` | `/en/large-taxi-kaiserslautern` | footer + service card |
| Courier runs | `/de/kurierfahrten-kaiserslautern` | `/en/courier-service-kaiserslautern` | footer + service card |
| Business accounts | `/de/geschaeftskunden-taxi-kaiserslautern` | `/en/business-taxi-accounts-kaiserslautern` | footer + service card |
| Airport transfer | `/de/flughafentransfer-kaiserslautern` | `/en/airport-transfer-kaiserslautern` | footer + service card |
| Ramstein Air Base | `/de/taxi-ramstein-air-base` | `/en/taxi-ramstein-air-base` | footer + related links |
| Imprint | `/de/impressum` | `/en/imprint` | footer |
| Privacy | `/de/datenschutz` | `/en/privacy` | footer |

Every one of the six services on the services page has its own landing page.
All seven landing pages are deliberately kept out of the main menu: they are
linked from the footer, from the matching service card, and from each other — a
page linked only from the footer is close to an orphan as far as search engines
are concerned.

### The home page carries every menu section

Hero → services → the full fare table → how it works → photo → service area →
contact → **the booking widget**. A visitor who never clicks anything can still
see what a ride costs and book one. The widget is embedded twice (home and the
booking page) from a single `BookingWidget` component.

A URL without a language prefix (`/krankenfahrten-kaiserslautern`) redirects to
the German version.

---

## Language handling

`src/proxy.ts` reads the browser's `Accept-Language` header, honours its `q`
weights, and redirects to `/de` or `/en`. Anything that is not English falls
back to German. **Nothing is stored** — no cookie, no fingerprint, which is also
why the privacy policy can stay short.

The language switcher keeps you on the same page rather than dropping you on
the home page.

### Editing content

All text lives in **`src/lib/i18n/de.ts`** and **`src/lib/i18n/en.ts`**. English
is type-checked against German, so adding a key to one and forgetting the other
**fails the build** instead of silently shipping a gap.

Name, address, phone, and coordinates live once in **`src/lib/business.ts`** and
feed the header, footer, contact page, legal pages, and structured data.

### Adding a page

1. Add a key to `pageKeys` and a slug for both languages in `src/lib/i18n/routes.ts`
2. Add the copy and a `seo` entry to both dictionaries
3. Render it in `src/app/[locale]/[slug]/page.tsx`

Navigation, sitemap, and hreflang pick it up automatically.

## The logo

`src/lib/logo.ts` is off by default, so the header and footer show a text
wordmark. Save the artwork into `public/logo/` and fill that file in, and both
switch to the real logo — nothing else to change.

The logo is black and yellow on white, which cannot sit directly on the dark
footer: the black "CITY" and "KAISERSLAUTERN" would disappear. `Wordmark`
therefore puts it on a white plate — invisible against the light header, and a
deliberate brand card against the dark footer.

## Photos

`public/photos/` holds the imagery; `src/lib/photos.ts` is the registry that
carries dimensions, per-language alt text, and licence metadata.

The one photo shipped is a real picture of **Kaiserslautern Hauptbahnhof**
(Gerd Eichmann, CC BY 4.0) — a genuine local landmark and a place taxis actually
wait. It is deliberately *not* a stock photo of someone else's taxi, which would
misrepresent the fleet.

CC BY requires naming the photographer, so `PhotoCredits` renders the credits at
the end of the Impressum straight from the registry. **Replace this with photos
of your own cars and drivers** — a real vehicle outside a recognisable place
beats any stock image for trust, and needs no credit line. Drop the file in,
update the entry, and delete the `credit` block.

## SEO

- Unique title and meta description per page, per language
- Canonical URL and `hreflang` alternates (`de`, `en`, `x-default`) on every page
- `sitemap.xml` (20 URLs with language alternates) and `robots.txt`
- `lastmod` driven by `business.contentUpdatedAt`, not the build clock — a build
  timestamp would tell crawlers every page changed on every deploy
- JSON-LD: `TaxiService` with address, phone, and geo coordinates on the home
  page; `BreadcrumbList` on sub-pages; `Service` and `FAQPage` on the landing
  and fares pages (FAQ blocks are eligible for rich results)
- Social card generated per language, `summary_large_image` on every page
- `robots` directives set `max-snippet:-1` and `max-image-preview:large`
- Localised URL slugs so each language ranks on its own terms — the booking
  slug, H1, title and nav label all use *bestellen*, which is what people
  actually search in German, rather than *buchen*
- `potentialAction: ReserveAction` on the business, declaring that a ride can
  be ordered on the site rather than only advertised there

**No `aggregateRating` on purpose.** Google does not allow a business to mark up
its own review score, and doing so can trigger a manual action. The 5.0 / 7
reviews line stays as visible text.

## Notes and gotchas

- **The booking widget's origin.** taxi.de's own snippet accepts a resize
  message from *any* origin. Ours validates it — but note the frame is served
  from `www.taxi.de` and posts its height from `oldiframe.taxi.de`, so the check
  covers subdomains, not one exact origin. If the widget stops resizing, look
  there first.
- **The booking widget's palette must stay light.** The colours in
  `widgetPalette` (`src/components/sections/BookingWidget.tsx`) are baked into
  the iframe URL. taxi.de **ignores `box`** and hardcodes the input fields to
  white, while **`txt1` colours both the labels and the text typed into those
  inputs**. A dark palette therefore renders customer input as white on white —
  and because placeholders use `txt2` and still look correct, it is invisible
  until someone tries to book. If you change these, verify by loading the iframe
  URL directly and reading `getComputedStyle` on a real `<input>`.
- **The proxy matcher must exclude generated metadata routes** (`icon`,
  `opengraph-image`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`) or the favicon gets redirected
  to `/de/icon` and never loads.
- **`dynamicParams = false`** on the slug route means unknown URLs never reach a
  locale segment, so the 404 cannot know which language was wanted. That is why
  `app/not-found.tsx` answers in both languages and needs no JavaScript.
- **Grid items need `min-w-0`** around the wide tables. Without it a grid item's
  default `min-width: auto` lets the table push the whole page sideways on a
  phone instead of scrolling inside its own box.
- **Light and dark** both supported via `prefers-color-scheme`. `--accent` is
  the taxi yellow for fills; `--accent-text` is the darker tone for
  accent-coloured *text*, which would otherwise fail contrast on light grounds.
- **`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`** are generated by `next dev` and reappear if deleted.
